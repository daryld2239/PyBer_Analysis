# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### The purpose of this project is to analyze data provided by a ridesharing company called PyBer to calculate metrics related to the total weekly fares for each city type the rideshare company operates in. The Datasets containing ride and city data were used to calcutate metrics such as total drivers, total fares, total rides, average fare per ride and driver for each ot he respective city types. With these data sets I was able to create a data frame to find the average fare per week from January 1st 2019 to April 2th 2019 for each of the city types. The dataframe from the analysis provided the data needed to visualize the toatl weekly fares for each in city with mutiple-line graph. The metrics and visualization created was then analyzed to provide recommendations to the CEO of Pyber to address any disparities among the city types.

## Results

### The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

### From this dataframe we can see that Urban cities have the most amount of rides and drivers and rural cities have the least. As a result the city type Urban brings the most revenue as we can see in the Total Fares column and rural cities bring the least amount of revenue. However, as we analyze the Average Fare per Ride column of this dataframe we can see that Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride, meaning that there is a chance of more revenue in this city type for every ride increase compared to Urban city types wich has the lowest average fare per ride. Other metric that we can see in this dataframe is the average fare per driver, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.

### A multiple line chart was also created as follows as part of the analysis to help us visualize and perform analysis of the Total Fares from January 1 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city types.

### In this time period analyzed for the total fare for each of the ciy types we can quickly oberve that Urban city types had the highest total fares for all the weeks and rural areas had the least. We can also observe that the 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time. Urban cities aslo seem to bring a lot of revenue in the first and third week of March. Towards the start of January 2019 and towards the end of April all Fares for each city type are showling decline.

## Summary

### Based on the analysis my business recommendations to Pyber are: Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
